Simple check list from AllenNLP repo: https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/blob/main/setup.py

To create the package for pypi.

1. Create the release branch named: v<RELEASE>-release, for example v4.19-release. For a patch release checkout the
   current release branch.

   If releasing on a special branch, copy the updated README.md on the main branch for your the commit you will make
   for the post-release and run `make fix-copies` on the main branch as well.

2. Run `make pre-release` (or `make pre-patch` for a patch release) and commit these changes with the message:
   "Release: <VERSION>" and push.

3. Go back to the main branch and run `make post-release` then `make fix-copies`. Commit these changes with the
   message "v<NEXT_VERSION>.dev.0" and push to main.

# If you were just cutting the branch in preparation for a release, you can stop here for now.

4. Wait for the tests on the release branch to be completed and be green (otherwise revert and fix bugs)

5. On the release branch, add a tag in git to mark the release: "git tag v<VERSION> -m 'Adds tag v<VERSION> for pypi' "
   Push the tag to git: git push --tags origin v<RELEASE>-release

6. Build both the sources and the wheel. Do not change anything in setup.py between
   creating the wheel and the source distribution (obviously).

   Run `make build-release`. This will build the release and do some sanity checks for you. If this ends with an error
   message, you need to fix things before going further.

   You should now have a /dist directory with both .whl and .tar.gz source versions.

7. Check that everything looks correct by uploading the package to the pypi test server:

   twine upload dist/* -r testpypi
   (pypi suggest using twine as other methods upload files via plaintext.)
   You may have to specify the repository url, use the following command then:
   twine upload dist/* -r testpypi --repository-url=https://test.pypi.org/legacy/

   Check that you can install it in a virtualenv by running:
   pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi transformers

   Check you can run the following commands:
   python -c "from transformers import pipeline; classifier = pipeline('text-classification'); print(classifier('What a nice release'))"
   python -c "from transformers import *"
   python utils/check_build.py --check_lib

   If making a patch release, double check the bug you are patching is indeed resolved.

8. Upload the final version to actual pypi:
   twine upload dist/* -r pypi

9. Copy the release notes from RELEASE.md to the tag in github once everything is looking hunky-dory.
